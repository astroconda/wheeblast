# wheeblast

## Requirements

- Docker

## Using

1. Edit `etc/config.sh`
2. Run `start.sh`
3. Drink coffee

Wheels are placed in the `wheelhouse` and source distribution archives end up in `disthouse`. Both directories are automatically created for you.

In order to upload packages you will need to install `twine` and configure `~/.pypirc` (or local configuration file) to point to an index of your choice.

## Encouragement

This is a proof of concept. Use at your own risk.

Good luck.
